# AppMarketplaceBlazorFront

A Website for an apps marketplace platform built with C#, ASP.NET, Blazor and Tus protocol(for apps uploading). A website communicates with a web api of an app marketplace platform.

# Requirements

- .NET 8.0

# Setup

For development of this project I use Visual Studio 2022 with ASP.NET Components installed.

Backend Web Api endpoints are hardcoded in the code which I should probably change, but It is what it is for now.

So in the end to launch the website you would have to make sure that those hardcoded api endpoints refer to valid running web api.
